Known MAX Bugs
==============

Last update: 19 Mar 1998, Aurel Huber

*** please remove entries when bugs have been fixed! ***

* [A.Huber, 19 Mar 1998]
  Runtime error messages display incorrect filenames
  (source code position information from mpp and cmax is ignored)

  Approach to solve this problem:
    - edit file max_sgen.c
    - create a macro FILE similar to the macro LINE
    - replace occurences of '_m' with this macro
