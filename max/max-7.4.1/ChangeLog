  MAX 7.3.1, 1. Juli 1997, RSE
  ============================

  o fixed a problem on error messages: the file was not
    displayed, so the error message was useless when the
    preprocessor was used.
  o created this ChangeLog file


  MAX 7.4.0, March 1998, A. Huber
  ===============================

  o included the Constraint preprocessor CMAX
  o small extensions to MAX scanner specification max_scan.l. MAX now
    supports source code position tags as generated by CMAX. So error
    messages will always include the correct source code location.
  o fixed C-compiler options so gcc can be used on HPUX without problems
