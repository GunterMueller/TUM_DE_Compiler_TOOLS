MAKING CHANGES TO THE CMAX sources
==================================

If you want to fix bugs or make extensions to cmax please follow the
following rules:

The file CHANGELOG contains a revision history.
Enter a new entry describing the purpose of the change and the place where
the change was made (filename/function).
Include comments in the changed file(s) describing the change exactly.

Bootstrapping notice:

if you want to make changes to cmax_spec.cm make sure you can always
generate a version of cmax that can compile the new specificaion.
That means you always need working bootstrap files stdmax_spec.m.B and
cmax_solver.c.B (a backup copy of a working cmax program is also useful).
If your new cmax_spec.cm definitely works you can generate new
bootstrap files with 'make bootstrapfiles' (takes some time). The
old bootstrap files are saved in *.B.orig .


Changing the code generator:

If you change the MAX code that cmax emits you can use the tcl shell script
stripscp.tcl in this directory to make the generated code readable.
You can then locate errors much easier.
(Simply execute ../stripscp.tcl stdmax_spec.m in the gen directory.)
