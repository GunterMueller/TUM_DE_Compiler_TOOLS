Installation instructions for CMAX 2.1.0
========================================

If you use CMAX as part of the MAX distribution (version 7.4.0 and
above) simply install the whole MAX system which includes cmax
(See the corresponding file INSTALL in the root directory of the
MAX distribution).

If you want to generate a standalone version of CMAX (you will need MAX
too in version 7.2 or above) follow these instructions:
  1. 'cp Makefile.standalone Makefile'
  2. adapt MACHINE.flg to the system you use
  3. enter the directory you want cmax to be installed at the beginning
     of Makefile
  4. 'make'
  5. 'make install' 
  6. 'make clean' removes generated files not needed anymore
  7. 'make realclean' removes all generated files
