    implementation

Version 2.0.0: May 1997
  * version with revised syntax and complete implementation

Version 2.0.1: Nov 1997
  * removed minor bugs

Version 2.1.0: Mar 1998
  * added support for mpp preprocessor and integrated with MAX 7.3.x.
  * CMAX is part of the MAX 7.4.0 distribution.
  * as empty strings can now be concatenated in MAX the workaround
    for that bug (using a function ES()) has been removed
  * added comfortable syntax for constructing lists:
    - [<ListSort> <expr1>,...,<expr2>] can now be used instead of
      appback(...appback( <ListSort>(), <expr1> )...,<exprn>)
    - <expr1> ++ ... ++ <exprn> can now be used instead of the old-fashioned
      conc(<expr1>,...(conc(<exprn-1>, <exprn>)...)
    - <expr1> @@ <expr2> can now be used instead of appback(<expr1>,<expr2>)
    - <expr1> :: <expr2> can now be used instead of appfront(<expr1>,<expr2>)
