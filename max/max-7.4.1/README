  MAX -- the Munich Attribute system for uniX

  Version 7.4.1 (08-04-1998)

  MAX is a system that supports programming language specification and 
  implementation. It provides a functional, attribute-based framework with 
  order-sorted recursive data types for the specification of syntax and 
  static semantics. Abstract state machines are used for the specification 
  of dynamic semantics.

  From a specification the MAX system generates an attribute evaluator and
  an implementation for the abstract state machine. The powerful interface
  to C programs enables flexible interactions with other tools, in particular
  scanners and parsers.
  
  The Constraint preprocessor CMAX provides support for the constraint-based
  specification of type-analysis and dataflow-analysis problems.
